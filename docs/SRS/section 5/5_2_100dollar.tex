\noindent\textbf{Description of Technique}

The 100 Dollar Test is a ratio scale technique where each stakeholder distributes 100 points across all requirements according to their perceived importance and value.

\noindent\textbf{Application Process}

Each team member independently allocated 100 points across requirements from Section 4. The allocations were then aggregated by calculating average points, considering factors such as business value, user impact, technical feasibility, and dependencies.
