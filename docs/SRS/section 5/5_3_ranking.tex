\noindent\textbf{Application Process}

After completing the 100 Dollar Test, the team reviewed point allocations and established a final ranking considering technical dependencies, implementation cost, and strategic importance for initial release.

The ranking shows some differences from the 100 Dollar Test results. Notably, PR1 (User authentication) is ranked first because it is a foundational requirement that must be implemented before most other features can function. Although it received fewer points in the 100 Dollar Test, its technical dependency elevated its rank. Similarly, DL1 (Web scraping) ranks second as it provides the essential data foundation for the entire application.
