% Section 5: Requirements Prioritization
\section{Requirements Prioritization}

This section applies three different prioritization techniques to the CookWise requirements identified in Section 4. The techniques used are the 100 Dollar Test (ratio scale), Ranking (ordinal scale), and Numerical Assignment (categorical scale). By comparing results across all three techniques, we establish a final consolidated priority ranking to guide the release planning process.
