\subsection{Brainstorming}

\textbf{Selection Rationale:} Brainstorming was used to generate creative solution ideas through two strategic sessions: one before interviews to formulate questions, and one after interviews to develop solution ideas based on validated user pain points.

\textbf{Execution:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participants:} All four team members (Project Manager, Customer Coordinator, two Project Members)
    \item \textbf{Session 1 - Pre-Interview (90 min):} Generated 18 hypothetical pain points to inform interview questions around: "What problems might budget-conscious families face when planning meals and shopping for groceries?"
    \item \textbf{Session 2 - Post-Interview (90 min):} Generated 23 feature ideas based on five key user insights from interviews. Ideas were captured on whiteboard following classic brainstorming principles (no criticism during generation, encouraging wild ideas, building on others' suggestions)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Requirements Elicited:}

\caption{Requirements from Brainstorming}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Requirement ID} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
PR2 & AI generated recipe recommendations using discounted ingredients \\
\hline
PR3 & Recipe filtering (cuisine, dietary restrictions, cooking time, difficulty) \\
\hline
PR4 & Automatic shopping list generation from selected recipes \\
\hline
PR8 & Store recommendation based on total cost and location \\
\hline
PR9 & Display detailed savings calculation \\
\hline
PR11 & Show additional ingredients needed, prioritizing sale items \\
\hline
PR13 & Store user preferences for items and recipes \\
\hline
QR1 & Performance: Fast recipe generation and page loading \\
\hline
QR2 & Usability: Easy first-time experience \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Insight:}

Comparing Session 1 hypotheses with interview findings revealed significant mismatches. The team initially assumed users wanted multi-store shopping optimization, but interviews showed strong preference for single-store convenience, validating the importance of user research before finalizing requirements.
