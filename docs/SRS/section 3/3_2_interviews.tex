\textbf{Execution:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participants:} 10 individuals in Karlskrona (5 university students, 2 professionals, 3 household members)
    \item \textbf{Duration:} 5-10 minutes per interview
    \item \textbf{Method:} Semi-structured, in-person interviews focusing on recent shopping experiences
    \item \textbf{Topics Covered:} Meal planning habits, store selection criteria, price comparison behaviors, recipe discovery
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Requirements Elicited:}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Requirement ID} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textit{\textbf{Domain Requirements}}} \\
\hline
DL3 & Single store shopping constraint \\
\hline
DL4 & Include all applicable promotions in basket price \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textit{\textbf{Product Requirements}}} \\
\hline
PR2 & AI recipe suggestions using discounted ingredients \\
\hline
PR8 & Store recommendation based on total cost and distance \\
\hline
PR9 & Display detailed savings breakdown \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textit{\textbf{Quality Requirements}}} \\
\hline
QR1 & Performance critical (time savings valued) \\
\hline
QR3 & Reliability critical (price data accuracy) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Insights:}

Interviews revealed two critical findings:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Users strongly prefer single-store shopping despite being price-conscious, validating DL3 as a fundamental constraint.

    \item Time is valued more than money, with users spending 30+ minutes weekly manually matching sales to recipes, elevating QR1 (performance) to top priority.
\end{enumerate}
