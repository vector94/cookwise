\subsection{Requirements Workshop}

\textbf{Selection Rationale:} A requirements workshop was conducted to consolidate findings from brainstorming and interviews into structured, traceable requirements including domain models, refined specifications, and traceability documentation.

\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{Execution:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Participants:} All four team members (Project Manager: Asif, Customer Coordinator: Letian Zhou, Project Members: Runlin, Oghenero)
    \item \textbf{Duration:} 4 hours in group room with large screen and whiteboard
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 - Domain Modeling (90 min):} Created Entity Relationship Diagram identifying core entities (User, Recipe, Ingredient, Store, Sale Item, Shopping List, Rating)
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 - Requirement Refinement (120 min):} Reviewed and refined all preliminary requirements for clarity, completeness, and traceability
    \item \textbf{Phase 3 - Traceability Mapping (30 min):} Linked requirements back to interview insights and business goals
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Requirements Elicited:}

DR1 & Core entity data models (User, Recipe, Ingredient, Rating, Store, Sale Item) \\
\hline
DR2 & Relationship models (Recipe-Ingredient, Shopping List, Shopping List Item) \\
\hline
DR3 & Data interchange formats (JSON for APIs, CSV/JSON for export, HTML parsing) \\
\hline
DR4 & System states (user sessions, operational states, recipe generation, shopping list) \\

\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textit{\textbf{Refined Product Requirements}}} \\
\hline
PR1 & External authentication (Google/Apple ID) \\
\hline
PR5 & User ratings and feedback for recipes (added during workshop discussion) \\
\hline
PR6 & Store AI generated recipes and their details \\
\hline
PR7 & Display complete recipe details with step by step instructions \\
\hline
PR10 & Search recipes by specific ingredients \\
\hline
PR12 & Daily web scraping to gather and update item data from store websites \\
\hline
PR14 & Display interactive map with store locations and navigation \\
\hline
PR15 & Calculate and display average ratings for recipes \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textit{\textbf{Domain Requirements (refined)}}} \\
\hline
DL1 & Data sourced from store websites via web scraping (API partnerships future goal) \\
\hline
DL2 & Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR) \\
\hline
DL5 & Rate limits and operational boundaries for external interfaces \\
\hline
DL6 & Domain events triggered by user actions and system operations \\
\hline

\textbf{Key Insights:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ERD creation revealed CookWise's value proposition depends on accurate, current sale price data, elevating QR3 (reliability/data accuracy) to top priority.

    \item The workshop confirmed DL3 (single store shopping) as a fundamental domain constraint, reflected in the ERD by linking each shopping list to exactly one store.

    \item Collaborative modeling revealed technical dependencies: PR1 (user accounts) must precede PR13 (preferences), and DL1 (sale data) plus DR1 (recipe database) must exist before PR2 (recipe suggestions) can function.
\end{enumerate}
