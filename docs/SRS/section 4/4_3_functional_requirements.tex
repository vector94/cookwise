\subsection{Functional Product Level Requirements}

\noindent\textbf{PR1:} The system shall authenticate users through external authentication services (e.g., Google/Apple ID).

\textbf{PR2:} The system shall invoke the AI Recipe Generation API with currently discounted ingredients, user dietary restrictions, and cuisine preferences to generate recipe suggestions.

\textbf{PR2.1:} The system shall display the top 5 AI-generated recipes ranked by cost savings.

\textbf{PR3:} The system shall filter recipe search results based on cuisine, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten free), budget, cooking time, difficulty level, and user ratings.

\textbf{PR4:} The system shall automatically generate a consolidated shopping list when the user selects one or more recipes, aggregating ingredient quantities for duplicates and applying current sale prices where available.

\textbf{PR5:} The system shall record individual user ratings (1-5 scale) and text feedback submitted by users for recipes.

\textbf{PR6:} The system shall store recipes generated by AI and their details (e.g., id, ingredients, instructions, rating).

\textbf{PR7:} The system shall display recipe details including ingredients, cooking time, difficulty level, step by step cooking instructions, and nutritional data.

\textbf{PR8:} The system shall display store price comparisons and distances from user location for each store carrying the shopping list items.

\textbf{PR9:} The system shall display total savings amount and itemized price differences between regular and sale prices.

\textbf{PR10:} The system shall display recipes containing ingredients specified in the user's search query.

\textbf{PR11:} The system shall display all ingredients needed for selected recipes, highlighting which ingredients are currently on sale and listing sale items first in the display order.

\textbf{PR12:} The system shall gather and update product data (product name, regular price, sale price, discount percentage, sale validity dates, and product category) from grocery store websites through web scraping once per day at 02:00 local time (scheduled during low-traffic hours to minimize server load on retailer websites and ensure stores have updated their daily promotions).

\textbf{PR13:} The system shall store user preferences for ingredients and recipes.

\textbf{PR14:} The system shall provide store location information with "Get Directions" links that redirect users to their preferred external mapping application (Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.) with the selected store address pre-populated.

\textbf{PR15:} The system shall calculate and display the average rating (aggregated from all user ratings per PR5) for each recipe, showing both the numerical average and the total number of ratings.
